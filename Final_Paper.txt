In the beginning, not much is known about the beast. The littluns are too innocent and young to understand death. “’Tell us about the snake-thing.’ ‘Now he says it was a beastie’” (Golding 35). This quote shows that the littluns are ignorant to the identity of the beast. The island represents the Garden of Eden, and the snake is the devil in the Garden. In Lord of the Flies, the beast is first recognized as a snake. Adam and Eve were innocent to the true identity of Satan, and the littluns are innocent to the true identity of the beast. “’That little ‘un’ gasped Piggy – ‘him with the mark on his face, I don’t see him. Where is he now?’ The crowd was as silent as death. ‘Him that talked about the snakes. He was down there –‘” (Golding 46). Here, the crowd is instantly assuming the worst. This represents their innocence, as it is easy to make assumptions and fear the unknown. “Children are specifically used to show that even the innocence of childhood can be corrupted by fears from within” (Bryfonski 93). Irrational fears can lead to blindly fighting, and savages tend to fight blindly.
The boys are ignorant to evil and deny it in the beginning. “In the beginning, when they boys are still in possession of their civilized veneer, they are dressed in school uniforms, clothes that make readers think of lessons, rules, and authority” (Olsen 34). Civilization is simply order. “’The thing is – Fear can’t hurt you any more than a dream. There aren’t any beasts to be afraid of on this island” (Golding 82). Here, the boys do not believe in the beast. They even go so far as to deny its very existence.
The boys become slowly corrupted by the true beast. “Jack rushed towards the twins. ‘The rest are making a line. Come on!’ ‘But-‘ ‘-we-‘ ‘Come on! I’ll creep up and stab-‘ The mask compelled them” (Golding 64). Masks hide a person’s true identity. For example, robbers wear a mask so the victims can’t recognize them. The identity of the beast is still unknown to everyone. This is the first point in the book where the boys show the same traits as the beast; they are unknown creatures fighting and killing. “The boys strip for the sheer anarchic fun of being naked. They allow their neatly trimmed hair and nails to grow unchecked. They forget hygiene. Their clothes, their teeth, and their bodies become dirty” (Olsen 34). The lack of civilization removes the need to be clean around others. Cleanliness also represents purity and innocence, so the boys are slowly losing their innocence.
As the story goes on, the boys become more corrupted over time. Every time they hunt, they revert more to their primal instincts.
